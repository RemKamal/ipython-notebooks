        "  'U.S. IMMIGRATION RULES SPARK CONGRESS OBJECTIONS\\n\\nNew immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S. Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress, sources on Capitol Hill said. USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities. The department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops, Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane, the New York Times reported yesterday. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which is \"a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,\" Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said. Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision, farm industry sources said. Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said livestock producers were \"desperate\" because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry. A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and Spanish reeds was \"marginal.\" In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees \"a tough call,\" this source said. USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released, probably some time later this month. While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question, congressional sources said. The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill. Congressional staff members estimate the special farm worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to 350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply for temporary, then permanent, resident status. Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  'CUBA CRUDE SUGAR HARVEST FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE\\n\\nCuban president Fidel Castro told a Congress of the Union of Young Communists here that the production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule. In a speech Sunday, published in today\\'s official paper GRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously interrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in the central and western parts of the island. The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvesters scheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year were particularly \"vulnerable,\" as muddy fields prevent operations. Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign. However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year\\'s 7.2 mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest was 8.2 mln tonnes. The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the present shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, the official said. Reuter \\x03',\n",

The telephone company said it asked the PSC on Nov. 7 for permission to increase its prices for intrastate private line services, used mainly by large business customers, which ATT said were priced below its access costs. \"Private line service has been grossly underpriced since 1984, and, therefore, it has been subsidized by all long distance users,\" Terry Hobbs, assistant vice president said. \"As a result of today\\'s PSC decision to allow our private line service prices to cover their access costs, these subsidies will end and we\\'ll be able to reduce basic long distance rates for everyone,\" he added.

He told reuters June 30 was the closing date. He said the measure was not linked to peru's foreign debt position. Chase is one of peru's top private banking creditors. Peru is over 700 mln dlrs in arrears on its interest owed to its 280 or so private foreign bank creditors, bankers said. Sosa said chase opened its local consumer banking operation in september 1984. It held the equivalent of around four mln dlrs in deposits and had extended the equivalent of about five mln dlr in loans. The bank still had to decide whether it would sell the holdings to another banking institution before closing the operation, he said. The closing of chase's consumer operation will leave only five foreign banks operating this service in peru. Two of them are institutions from the united states and there is one each from britain, japan and spain. Reuter \\x03\",\n",

In remarks prepared for an address to members of the University of Chicago\\'s Graduate School of Business, Yeutter said many Congressional proposals do not appear to be overtly protectionist, yet their undeniable effect would be to close off market opportunitites, just as exchange rate movement is unleashing such opportunities for the first time in several years. \"Despite all our progress on trade policy and despite the President\\'s comprehensive competitiveness initiative, there are many in Congress who still are supporting trade bills containing many dangerous provisions,\" Yuetter said. Yeutter said many countries would prefer U.S. retaliation to opening their own markets. \"We should be intelligent enough to not let them off the hook that easily,\" he said. He said that tough but flexible legislative language is infinitely preferable to tough but inflexible language. Both House and Senate trade proposals place undesirable limits on Presidential discretion, he said. \"Limiting the President\\'s ability to consider all available options on issues as sensitive as these would be most unwise,\" Yeutter said. \"That could readily provoke retaliation, which would unneccesarily embroil us in trade wars, injuring most competitive export industries.\" Yeutter said present U.S. trade laws are fundamentally sound. President Reagan has threatened or implemented retaliation eight times in the last 18 months -- most recently in the case of Japanese semiconductors being dumped in world markets. \"He took these steps as a last resort, only after carefully analyzing all the contingencies on a case by case basis and only after determining that such actions would open markets to American exports\", he said. Yeutter said it would be foolish to attempt to solve the U.S. trade deficit by focusing on trade policy alone. He added that the trade deficit was created primarily by macroeconomic policy shortcomings here and abroad. Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  \"BRAZIL SETS UP SPECIAL DEBT COMMISSION\\n\\nBrazil has set up a special debt commission, headed by Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, to be responsible for renegotiating Brazil's 109 billion dollar foreign debt, officials said. The principal negotiator on the commission, created by President Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister Ramiro Saraiva Guerreiro. Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commission by eight senior officials, including a representative of the National Security Council. The creation of the commission is intended to underscore the Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue is essentially political and that a political solution must be found to the problem. On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dollar foreign bank debt to try to force the issue. Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they are equally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief. Yesterday Funaro travelled to the United States for fresh debt negotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasilia's suspension of interest payments. Funaro was due to hold talks in New York today with the private sector, before travelling to Washington for the semi- annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Officials said the new commission would start work in earnest when Funaro returns from the United States. Yesterday Funaro called for a new forum for discussion of the foreign debt. He suggested direct participation of the governments of creditor countries in debt talks. In negotiations on commercial debt, talks have traditionally been restricted to banks. The creation of the new commission brings Brazil's highly professional Foreign Ministry much more into the forefront on the debt issue than it has been in the past. During the period of military rule, which ended in 1985, the Foreign Ministry played a very minor role in debt policy. But the new commission has diplomats among its members and the chief negotiator, Saraiva Guerreiro, is a seasoned envoy with a long diplomatic career. Reuter \\x03\",\n",

The communique said the Iranian troops which attacked the Qutaiba front were annihilated but the invading force managed to gain some footholds on the other fronts. \"Fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and all morning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the Iranians from all the positions they gained at the Muthanna front and the situation ended in Iraq\\'s favour,\" the communique said.

A Spokesman for Texaco had no immediate comment. Attorneys representing Texaco were not immediately available. The filing follows yesterday\\'s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, overturning a lower federal court decision that had cut Texaco\\'s bond to one billion dlrs. The high court ruled that the issue should first be considered by Texas state courts. Texaco yesterday said it would soon file to prevent enforcement of the bond, but it was unsure whether it would make the filing in a District Court, the Court of Appeals or the Texas Supreme Court. Jeffers said Texaco chose the Appeals Court because it currently has jurisdiction in the case. According to Texas state law, Texaco could be forced to post the full amount of the judgement as a bond. If it failed to do so, Pennzoil could seek liens on Texaco\\'s assets for the amount of the judgement. Texaco\\'s filing contains a request to cut the amount of the bond to between one and 1.5 billion dlrs, Jeffers said. Asked what Pennzoil\\'s thought of that amount, he said, \"I don\\'t think it\\'s enough.\" Pennzoil has repeatedly said it would not seek to force Texaco to post the full amount of the judgement in the form of a bond, but has said it would seek other forms of security. \"We\\'ve recognized there are other alternatives to a bond,\" Jeffers, the Pennzoil attorney, said. Pennzoil will also have the right to respond to the filing but Jeffers said he was unsure when the response would be made. The dispute between Texaco and Pennzoil stems from the 1984 takeover of Getty Oil Co by Texaco. Pennzoil said the merger violated a prior agreement it had to buy Getty and sued Texaco. Since then, Pennzoil\\'s position has twice been upheld by Texas State Courts. The Judgement now stands at 10.3 billion dlrs, including interest, and is on appeal. Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  'BRAZIL\\'S DEBT CRISIS BECOMING POLITICAL CRISIS\\n\\nBrazil\\'s financial crisis is rapidly becoming a political and social crisis, and President Jose Sarney faces increasingly serious questions about his future. As Brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the United States this week, political analysts say Sarney\\'s administration has never appeared weaker. The full political price which Sarney will have to pay for the failure of the much-vaunted anti-inflation Cruzado Plan is still not clear. He might have to pay with the presidency. Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to pick a successor to Sarney early next year. The length of his term will be decided by a Constituent Assembly, and Sarney has been lobbying for a six-year term. Sarney came to power, without facing presidential elections, in March 1985, when the military bowed out after 21 years of rule. Although there was wide public support for direct elections for president, the military as one of their last acts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had more influence, make the choice. The college chose Tancredo Neves, a popular politician who headed the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), which had opposed military rule. In part to smooth relations with the military, Neves chose Sarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonial post of vice-president. But Neves died before he could take office and Sarney took power. He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the Cruzado Plan was wildly popular with inflation-weary Brazilians. But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has not been the same. \"The country is a rudderless ship,\" said a U.S. Diplomat, echoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea of how to tackle the economic crisis. Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticism coming from the business community, the trade unions, some of the military, the media and political opponents. Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarney\\'s decision announced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt. A motor industry executive said: \"The business community thinks Brazil should go to the IMF. Their rules are sometimes harsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house in order.\" Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, but disagree with other aspects of government policy. Since the end of February they have organized national strikes of seamen, bankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local stoppages and protests. Economic problems have prompted criticism from some military figures, including the last army ruler, General Joao Figueiredo. It is a sign of the times that almost daily military men deny there is going to be a coup. If the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors of Sarney\\'s fate will be the PMDB\\'s leaders. So far, they have not taken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections. But one PMDB leader, Senator Affonso Camargo, pointedly said yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the Consituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidency whenever it wished. In the media, Sarney has to contend with strong criticism. One senior political commentator, Fernando Pedreira of the Jornal do Brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week: \"President Sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but it is just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state of the country and the people since the immense failure of the Cruzado Plan. \"The disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, the enticement have been (and continue to be) too great, too profound.\"He called for direct elections early in 1988 as the only way out of the present crisis. One of Sao Paulo\\'s leading news magazines, Senhor, said in an editorial this week: \"The anarcho-populist government of President Jose Sarney has failed. Two years have already been too long for such a disastrous experience. \"It deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. The natural solution: direct elections soon.\" The government\\'s inability to control inflation is now bringing with it serious social problems. An explosion in rents in Sao Paulo has thrown tens of thousands of families onto the streets because they can no longer afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums. The local press says the city is experiencing the biggest wave of land invasions in its history. According to rental agencies, rents have increased 500 pct in little more than a year. Even the cheapest shacks now cost 2,000 cruzados (90 dollars) a month, half as much again as the minimum wage, which is all that many earn. Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Sao Paulo, warned yesterday of the possibility of \"a social conflict of unimaginable proportions.\" With his back to the wall politically and with social tensions rising, Sarney is no position to compromise on debt.

Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commission by eight senior officials, including a representative of the National Security Council. The creation of the commission is intended to underscore the Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue is essentially political and that a political solution must be found to the problem. On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr foreign bank debt to try to force the issue. Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they are equally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief.

Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel. \"Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong,\" Robert Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said. Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report. Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot. Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the close with support from the silver market, which was approaching two-year highs, traders said. Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher. Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies. In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year. Monday\\'s report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower. Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week. The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said. Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies. Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals. However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year.

        "  'TEXAS MAY CONSIDER INCOME TAX TO SOLVE BUDGET WOES\\n\\nThe State of Texas, faced with a record 5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, may have to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said. Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back when the state\\'s enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easily allowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporate income tax. However, last year\\'s dramatic slump in oil prices not only sent the Texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily into the state\\'s tax revenues. Both Moody\\'s Investor Services and Standard and Poor\\'s cut their credit ratings of the state to double A from the top triple A in early March. Moody\\'s Vice President George W. Leung said it was the first time Texas\\' rating had been lowered since 1962, adding the report noted that while \"the Legislature is now considering proposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects for full recovery are weak.\" With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by State Comptroller Bob Bullock, the Texas Legislature must grapple with a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 4.8 billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. No other state in U.S. history has faced such a deficit. \"There is a strong independent streak in Texans and five years ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislature would institute an income tax,\" said George Bland, Assistant Professor of Political Science at North Texas State University, adding, \"Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me it\\'s coming, it\\'s inevitable, it\\'s only a matter of time.\" State taxes on oil and gas production traditionally supplied as much as a third of the state\\'s revenues. However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent years, and with last year\\'s price slump, the state\\'s dependence on sales taxes is approaching 50 pct. Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a major factor in the state\\'s decision because under it sales taxes are no longer deductible from federal income tax while state income tax is. John Kennedy, senior research associate at the Austin-based Texas Research League said, \"There is a great deal of popular sentiment against it, plus the first plank of Governor Clements\\' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax.\" However, he said that since the oil price fall the state faced a choice of either instituting an income tax or broadening and possibly raising the sales tax. Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterprise at Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes, said he favored reforming the present tax system to take account of the changed structure of the economy. \"We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oil and agriculture and real estate and more on service industries, manufacturing and high-tech,\" Pejovich said. Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullock said, \"Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned the Legislature that if they get tired of looking at everything else, that\\'s the only option.\" Apart from Texas, states which have no individual income tax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruled that the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr deficit into the next biennium, even though the state consitution requires a balanced budget. But as State Treasurer Ann Richards said last Thursday, \"Jim Mattox\\'s decision today turns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must not think that the goose isn\\'t still cooking.\" Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spending cuts. But the state is already under pressure from a Federal District Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system -- or face 24 mln dlrs a month in fines. And U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett has accused the state, among others, of lax education reform. Earlier this year, both houses of the Legislature, citing financial restraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoning plans to require teachers to take competency tests. Bland said he believes the state will set up a commission next year to \"study alternative revenue sources,\" with an income tax being instituted as early as January 1989. \"If the political leaders are educated about (the effects of the Tax Reform Act), I think there will be a gradual drift toward income tax,\" he said.

Searle, a unit of Monsanto Co <MTC>, have terminated the distribution agreement under which Searle had exclusive rights to market Gynex's line of generic oral contraceptives. This means that Gynex Labs, 50 pct owned by Gynex and 50 pct by Watson Laboratories, will not get remuneration under the distribution agreement beyond the 650,000 dlrs received from Searle in February and March 1986. This has been applied to the costs of inventories. Searle and Gynex Labs will both bear costs involved with a product recall. Gynex Labs' cost is estimated at 900,000 dlrs, to be shared equally by Gynex Inc and Watson, it said. The companies ended the agreement when it was determined that Searle's product line sales and marketing commitment would not allow it to commit the necessary resources for the relaunch of the Gynex line of oral contraceptives, Gynex said. After launching the first two Gynex products in early February, Searle voluntarily recalled them in March as a preventive measure because a limited number of packages may have contained out of order or missing tablets.

Johnston, of Louisiana, and fellow Democrat William Proxmire of Wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accused the administration of covertly seeking early deployment as a political ploy to commit the United States to strategic defenses even after Reagan leaves office in 1989. \"This report exposes the fact that without a presidential directive or congressional consent, the SDI program ... is being changed to pursue a near-term deployment of strategic defenses,\" Proxmire, chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, said. \"In other words, they\\'re covertly reorienting the SDI program without congressional approval.\" Reuter \\x03',\n",

Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow, the Japanese officials said.

The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention.

Ruding, who is also chairman of the IMF\\'s policy-making Interim Committee, said he was reflecting a feeling within the two institutions. Asked whether his comments reflected a feeling the institutions were being unduly pressured by the Reagan administration, Ruding replied \"we should not go in the direction of politicisation of the two institutions.\" Ruding said \"no country large or small should push in that direction.\" He said he expected commercial bank lending to debtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace of lending recently. Ruding also said he did not expect any major initiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in the debt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debt crisis itself. In other remarks, Ruding said many countries supported a General Capital Increase for the World Bank and he expected Bank president Barber Conable also to express his support.

        "  'CURRENCY FUTURES TO KEY OFF G-5, G-7 MEETINGS\\n\\nNews of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial analysts said. \"If they (the finance ministers) give the market something really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar,\" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills. On the other hand, \"anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar,\" Mills said. Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar, nor will central bank intervention. \"A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar,\" said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM. \"If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level,\" he said. Technically, most currency futures are poised for another rise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday. \"Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you don\\'t need much to get things rolling,\" Sloane said. In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside. A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a breakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday. Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes. What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors. Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally. \"Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to calm people,\" said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics. The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade, Horner said. But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday. Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings. The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar\\'s range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June contract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday. If such a range does emerge from the meetings, \"we will have one more rally in the yen,\" Horner said. Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  'POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL\\n\\nBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth. In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said \"It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.\" He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home. \"A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,\" he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments. \"For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,\" he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan\\'s trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said. \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,\" he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar\\'s value could overshoot. REUTER \\x03',\n",

Under the law, wage cuts will be imposed on losing enterprises, while those failing to recover within a six-month grace period will face liquidation. The diplomats said Mikulic\\'s attempt to create a market economy is inevitable, but has still come as a shock to those accustomed to government subsidies. \"It was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed, but if an overdose is taken too abruptly, it may have adverse effects on the system,\" a Western diplomat said. He said if the law was applied too strictly it would probably provoke a new wave of strikes and unrest. Yugoslavia was swept by strikes last month following the introduction of a wage-freeze law, later amended to allow more flexibility and some exemptions in what some political analysts saw as a retreat by Mikulic. But with inflation moving towards 100 pct, trade union leaders have asked how much more deprivation workers can take. The union leaders said workers thoughout the country are already receiving salaries below limits set under existing law, while others have received no wages at all this year because their employers are unable to pay them. Workers also complain much of their income is taken in local, state and federal taxes. Many others are losing their motivation to work and confidence in government as they feel their decision-making powers are being eroded, trade union officials said. Meanwhile, the official Tanjug news agency reported a paper and cellulose factory at Ivangrad in the Montenegro republic closed yesterday and 2,000 of its workers were given \"temporary leave.\" Tanjug said the plant had been running at a loss for the 24 years it had been in operation, and its closure was the result of \"economic necessity\" rather than bankruptcy.

        "  'ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT\\n\\nMounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia\\'s exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said. They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo\\'s loss might be their gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan\\'s alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes. \"We wouldn\\'t be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MC.T>. \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <James Capel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. \"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan\\'s foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world\\'s largest. \"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,\" said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea\\'s trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports. \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong\\'s biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter,\" Button said. He said Australia\\'s concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia\\'s two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue. Japan\\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy. The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year. They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone\\'s avowed fiscal reform program.

He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered. Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made. The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week. \"Several factors make us move cautiously,\" Nainggolan said. \"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.\" Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said. The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia\\'s elections on April 23, traders said. Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world\\'s second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this.

Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position. \"We\\'ll be back in position in first place within three years,\" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo\\'s profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo\\'s branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank\\'s large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves. \"They\\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it\\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo\\'s problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other. \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\\'s version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities. \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That\\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo. The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary. \"We don\\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years,\" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. \"It\\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said Kleinwort\\'s Smithson. \"After that, it\\'s a question of absorbing and juggling around.

Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on May 6. Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today's allocation.

Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.

It reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986, compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.

        "  'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EXCESS MONEY HURTS THAI BANKS\\n\\nThailand\\'s improving economy may have helped its trade and finance position but it has also created major problems for local banks, Thai and foreign bankers said. They said a 900 mln dlr saving from cheaper imported oil and 19.7 pct export growth last year contributed to the country\\'s first current account surplus in 20 years. But the bright picture, together with a government program to help farmers cope with depressed commodity prices, coincides with sluggish investment by a private sector still feeling the lingering effects of the 1984-86 recession. Thai banks have had growing surplus funds and difficulties finding borrowers since the third quarter of 1986. Kunthon Narkprom, head of the budget and planning division of Thai Farmers Bank Ltd, estimated excess liquidity in banks peaked last month at 60 billion baht, three times what he considered normal. Bank of Thailand figures show total deposits in 1986 grew 12.7 pct to 627.7 billion baht, while lending rose only 3.4 pct to 548.6 billion. The lending/deposit ratio, which measures bank loans as a percentage of deposits, fell to 86.6 pct last month, the lowest since the 1970s, after averaging 96.6 pct in 1985. Thai banks have cut lending and deposit rates a record six times since January 1986, during which time the average minimum loan rate fell to 11.5 pct from 15.5 and the gross one-year fixed deposit rate to 7.25 pct from 11. Five banks announced last week they would cut their maximum lending rates to small borrowers by one percentage point to 14 pct. Kunthon of Thai Farmers estimated banks now have a combined 80 billion baht unused overdraft line as many small and medium-size companies delay borrowing in anticipation of more cuts in interest rates. The record liquidity has seriously hurt the profits of banks, which have been forced to invest idle funds in low-yield government securities. Kunthon said the banks hold four to 10 billion baht in short-term government bonds bought through the Bank of Thailand\\'s bond repurchase facility, double the normal amount. Thailand\\'s 16 local commercial banks registered one of their worst years in 1986, with overall profits falling over 30 pct after a 14 pct decline in 1985. Kunthon said profits should increase 10 pct this year as the banks adjust to the new interest rate structure. Olarn Chaipravat, senior executive vice president of Siam Commercial Bank Ltd, told reporters last week the liquidity problem stems partly from the fact most loan demands come from businesses seeking funds for small, labour-intensive projects. He said there are few large, capital-intensive projects and many borrowers go offshore to meet their requirements. Somboon Chinsavananond, Thai Farmers\\' fund management executive, said liquidity has been aggravated by the central bank\\'s policy of fixing a stable baht-dollar exchange rate which permits Thai companies to import dollar-denominated funds with a minimal risk of currency exchange losses. He said underlying bearishness towards the U.S. Dollar has encouraged foreign borrowers who hope to pay less on loan principal when their loans mature. Thai bankers said central bank governor Kamchorn Sathirakul last month rejected a request to increase a 10 pct withholding tax on interest on foreign loans, a measure they said would reduce foreign borrowings. The governor replied the bankers should extend more loans to rural areas instead. Bankers said some Thai banks have offered credit-worthy clients loans at near money market rates of seven to eight pct in a bid to compete with foreign funds. A market analyst at Siam Commercial Bank said bank lending at such rates amount to about 15 pct of all loans extended by the industry. A foreign banker, who requested anonymity, said the \"segmented market approach\" used by Thai banks for setting different lending rates has caused dislocation of funds in the financial sector, eroded bank profits and prevented banks from taking a more logical move of further cutting interest rates. He said the liquidity problem gives the Bank of Thailand a perfect opportunity to assert more control on the Thai money market. The Bank of Thailand is taking \"a step in the right direction\" by planning to float three billion baht in bonds to mop up part of the surplus, he said, but he added the bank has been lax in using its bond repurchase window as a tool to absorb or inject liquidity into the market. William Wu, head of the Treasury Unit of Chase Manhattan Bank N.A., Said the money market lacks the instruments to absorb liquidity and avoid sharp interest rate fluctuations. He said the liquidity has fuelled the stock market\\'s strongest rally in seven years and Thailand should seize the opportunity to develop the corporate bond market. REUTER \\x03',\n",

        "  'JAPANESE AUTOMAKERS TURN TO FOUR-WHEEL STEERING\\n\\nMajor Japanese automakers are gearing up to equip sporty models with four-wheel steering, a feature that could become standard on high-grade cars in the future, automotive industry sources said. Two companies are ready to market such cars soon, they said. Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with four-wheel steering from this Friday, and Mazda Motor Corp officials say a model with the new steering will be out by mid-year. Mazda aims to ship the cars overseas before year-end but the decision will depend on initial consumer reaction. Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticated four-wheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985. Toyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the field at a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it will use the system in the near future. Though major U.S. And European automakers have also researched and tested the four-wheel system, they say they are waiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and for further improvements in safety and costs. Four-wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre into parking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns. Mazda officials believe the new steering will improve safety. \"At extremes, four-wheel steering gives a driver more control,\" said one official. \"On slippery surfaces or at high speeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle.\" While acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a Honda engineer said: \"This invention is not intended to improve safety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily.\" Mazda\\'s electronic steering system tells the back wheels to turn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slow speeds but in the same direction at high speeds. Honda\\'s system, which is mechanical, is similar but the direction of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of the front wheels. With Nissan\\'s system the rear wheels move only parallel to the front. Automakers say professional drivers who have tested the four-wheel steering say it greatly improves handling. An official with one U.S. Vehicle manufacturer said four-wheel steering is a technical improvement, but it is uncertain whether it will translate into higher sales or profits. \"All automakers are interested in something new,\" he said. \"If it becomes a predominant factor, everyone will want to follow.\" The official said four-wheel steering is partly a gimmick to sell cars. \"It\\'s a benefit of a secondary nature compared with devices for fuel economy or emission control.\" General Motors Corp has developed a four-wheel steering system, but is unlikely to market it within the next five years, Y. Hojoh, engineer with the Japan branch of General Motors Overseas Corp, said. GM must consider the costs to the consumer, he added. The industry sources said the additional cost of the system in Japan would probably make little difference to the consumer as it would be added to already high-priced models. REUTER \\x03',\n",
        "  'JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.\\n\\nJapan\\'s Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said. \"Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers,\" the official, who declined to be named, said. \"Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market,\" he said. Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers. Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports. Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31. Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier. U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said. An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business. The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans. To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan\\'s top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products. But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector. \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official said.

He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus \"at a proper level.\" But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won. The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985. Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years. \"Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected,\" he said. Trade ministry officials said South Korea\\'s exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs. Kim said the swing of South Korea\\'s current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time. South Korea\\'s foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in Asia. \"This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy,\" Kim said. Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country\\'s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986. \"The government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,\" he said. Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul\\'s major trading partners, particularly the United States. \"We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level,\" Kim said.

The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said. The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C. The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the important capital and operating advantages gained by locating on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said. The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer that can replace tetra ethyl lead. Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of health concerns, the statement added. Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE, it said. Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia. The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on stream in late 1989, the statement said. REUTER \\x03\",\n",

IG-Metall, Western Europe\\'s largest union, is reviving its campaign for a 35-hour working week and is demanding a five pct pay increase. Strikes for a 35-hour week in 1984 brought West Germany\\'s automobile industry virtually to a standstill. The result of the 1984 campaign was a compromise reduction in working hours to 38.5 from 40. The talks which broke down yesterday were in the key North Wuerttemberg/North Baden area, which generally sets the trend for the rest of the country. IG-Metall official Ernst Eisenmann, speaking last night, blamed the failure of the negotiations on the employers. He said they had been uncompromising on the question of the shorter week. Hans-Peter Stihl, negotiating for the employers, said any plan to reduce working hours gradually to 35 hours was unacceptable. The employers have not made an official offer on cutting the working week, but sources involved in the negotiations say that they are working on the basis of a possible half-hour reduction from next year and a pay increase of 2.7 pct in 1987 and of 1.5 pct in 1988. The Union will propose that the negotiations be officially declared a failure and then a process of arbitration is likely. IG-Metall has said that cutting the working week will create jobs in West Germany where more than two mln people are unemployed. IG-Metall itself has about 2.5 mln members. IG-Metall has already been staging a series of \"warning strikes\" to press home demands for the 35-hour week. Yesterday, 23,000 engineering workers struck at 90 plants for one to two hours, according to an IG-Metall statement.

The composite index hit a record 405.13 early last week, nearly 50 pct up from the New Year when it stood at 264.82, but plunged to a 383.48 close on April 3, the day after the government intervened. Under the measures, industrial firms with bank loans worth 50 billion won or more must either offer new shares or issue convertible bonds to repay the loans. Securities houses will have to sell shares they are holding if the volume exceeds 40 pct of their paid-in capital. The ceiling for investment trust firms was fixed at 50 pct. South Korean firms have traditionally preferred obtaining low interest bank loans -- the current rate is 10 pct -- to issuing bonds at a higher rate or floating share issues with the attendant dividend pressures and launch expenses. The Seoul Stock Exchange, with 355 listed stocks, grew explosively in the first three months of the year, building on an already impressive 68.9 pct gain in 1986. Analysts now expect the market to pause temporarily and then resume its upward movement, despite the indirect government regulation. They said the continuous growth of the nation\\'s gross national product (GNP) and trade surplus, improved exports and good performances by industrial firms all fuelled the boom. The trade surplus widened to 460 mln dlrs in March from 110 mln in February, while government economists expect GNP to grow nine pct this year. Analysts said the deep slump in the real estate market also increased liquidity in the stock market. \"Many investors are still confident the market will not lose its strength.

        "  'JAPANESE ECONOMIC PACKAGE SEEN AS MAJOR CHANGE\\n\\nThe economic package unveiled yesterday by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) marks the start of a major shift away from the policies of the past, private economists and government officials said. \"A big step forward has been taken,\" said Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi. The package, seen as a response to mounting overseas pressure to boost the sagging Japanese economy, calls for a supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen later this year, plus increased imports. Although the measures must still gain the approval of the Finance Ministry, economists said the government will find it too difficult to alter the measures significantly once they have gained domestic and overseas backing. \"At last, the LDP and the Ministry of Finance are turning a corner,\" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd\\'s chief economist Masahiko Koido. For the past five years the government has adhered to a tight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficit financing bonds in 1990. To meet that goal, spending departments are required to submit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below the previous year and investment five pct below. Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the LDP\\'s policy affairs council, said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990 fiscal reform target, but should review the ceiling it places on public works spending. Even some Finance Ministry officials privately acknowledge that policy changes might be needed, including easing the government\\'s iron grip on spending. Economists said the government could meet its 1990 target and also increase spending by using money it got from the sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares and by taking advantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt. Officially, the Finance Ministry is adhering to its tight stance but some signs of change have appeared. \"We do not have any intention of abandoning our objective to restore fiscal balance,\" a Finance Ministry spokesman said. He said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goals simultaneously. These were reforming the government\\'s fiscal position and stimulating domestic demand. But the Finance Ministry spokesman added, \"In looking at the current situation of the economy and the relationship between Japan and the United States, we feel we have to place more emphasis on stimulating demand.\" Economists predict battles within the government over the coming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure the cracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown of fiscal discipline. \"The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole in the dike, it will lead to a flood,\" Industrial Bank\\'s Taketomi said. But Taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device in place to check excess spending for political reasons, is likely to give the go-ahead to a shift in policy. \"This seems to mark the first step toward a more active fiscal policy in response to requests from the international community,\" he said. Sumitomo\\'s Koido said if the government quickly implements the LDP\\'s 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the 1987/88 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct, His current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementary budget of around 1,000 billion yen.

Analysts said that the timing of the postponement of Superfan -- an 30,000 pound thrust upgrade of the consortium\\'s V2500 engine fitted to the A320 -- was embarrassing but should not be considered a serious blow. If anything, it indicated the financial prudence of the group, one added. The Rolls spokesman added that the decision did not affect the V2500 programme itself. Equally, there was the possibility that the consortium would go ahead with the Superfan later on.

        "  'SOUTH KOREA STUDIES RESTRUCTURING FINANCIAL SECTOR\\n\\nDeputy prime minister Kim Mahn-je said South Korea is studying various measures to reform what he described as its underdeveloped bank and financial sector. Kim, who is also economic planning minister, told a news conference the country\\'s banks and finance houses had not developed to keep pace with their industrial counterparts. He said two major factors had hampered the development of the financial sector -- high inflation and heavy government intervention in bank decision-making. He said in the past the government had pressed banks to give soft loans to industry to boost economic growth. Kim said the government would now give top priority to interest rate liberalisation. This could be achieved within several years, though not within one year. He said liberalisation was possible because South Korea\\'s current account had turned from a deficit to a surplus, which had brought in foreign funds and increased domestic savings. The current account recorded a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 after a deficit of 890 mln dlrs in 1985. But Kim said the government needed to reorganise much of the financial sector. Kim said mergers of some financial companies and the upgrading of others to merchant banks or full banks were being considered by the financial development committee of the finance ministry. He did not elaborate but said he expected no drastic measures to be announced this year. On liberalisation of the country\\'s stock market, Kim said despite Seoul\\'s determination to open it up, free investments there by foreigners would not be allowed in the near future because the market was currently \"over-heated.\" He said this was due to ample liquidity created partly by the country\\'s current account surplus. Kim said the market was extremely vulnerable to a sudden influx of foreign funds because it was still very small in terms of size and numbers of shareholders. \"Opening up the capital market must wait until the vulnerability to such an influx is removed,\" he said. He said only about one mln South Koreans, out of a population of 40 mln, invest in the Seoul market. REUTER \\x03',\n",

A year ago, the Amsterdam Bourse announced its own rules, effective from January 1, 1987, aimed at preventing unfair use of inside information in the trading shares listed on the exchange, but said back-up legislation was essential. The proposed law calls for up to two years imprisonment, fines of up to 100,000 guilders for an individual and one million guilders for a company, and repayment to the state of profits made from insider dealing. The proposed fines are higher than any currently in force in Dutch law, a joint statement from the two ministries said. The draft law sets no limit to the illegal profits to be repaid. The amount would be determined by a court. A Finance Ministry spokesman said the time-frame for the introduction of the new legislation depended entirely on its reception in Parliament.

        "  'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING\\n\\nAustralian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets, analysts said. High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said. Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said. A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow. Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States. \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don\\'t know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said. \"There is a \\'flight to quality\\',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren\\'t too many other countries where you\\'d want to put your money.\" The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said. \"We\\'re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?\" But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said. \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government\\'s promised tough economic statement on May 14. While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said. \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn\\'t considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said. Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said. \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said. Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations. Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off the yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors. Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen. Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks. Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector. The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period. The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field. Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney\\'s five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought. \"They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.

        "  'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY\\n\\nKuwait\\'s oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say. Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens. Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before. This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986. Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\\'s doorstep, which threatens the emirate\\'s vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence. But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced. The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default. The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system. Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies. There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under. The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not. Banks\\' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil. Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say. Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah. But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products. Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude. Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady. External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf. Kuwait\\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year. But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say. In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars. This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall. Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next. \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is important.\" Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy. He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June. REUTER \\x03',\n",
        "  \"MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET\\n\\nMalaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers told Reuters. Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said. The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year. Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told Reuters. The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said. The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output. The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said. In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks. They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.

Banks have in the past used the two month lapse in loan registration to transfer money for lending to finance and insurance groups to avoid penalty reserve requirements for lending in excess of government set ceilings. The new rule brings loan reporting requirements for insurance and finance companies in line with those already applied to commercial banks, Ministry officials said. Borrowers have increasingly sought loans from finance and insurance companies after the central bank last year clamped down on what it called excessive bank lending. Bank lending dropped by five billion crowns in January from 260 billion crowns the previous month in response to the stricter penalty reserve requirements, Oslo bankers said. They said recent central bank cuts in the overnight rate it charges banks might offset new pressure on interest rates. REUTER \\x03',\n",

A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC\\'s outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB\\'s plans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of fiduciary duties.\" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company\\'s board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC\\'s minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company\\'s board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company\\'s retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC\\'s chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles\\' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC\\'s Hong Kong subsidiary <Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week\\'s board meeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15. \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in a statement. \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government\\'s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco\\'s court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial.\" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which are available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the <A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz\\'s Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June. \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz told Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\" The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company\\'s annual stockholders\\' meeting, scheduled for May 14. San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985.

        "  'POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL\\n\\nBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth. In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said \"It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit.\" He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home. \"A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,\" he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments. \"For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,\" he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan\\'s trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said. \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,\" he said.

Japan should not see industrializing Asian nations as mere competitors in its overseas and domestic markets but as countries that can contribute to the region's prosperity. The bank said trade relations between Japan and the Asian neighbouring countries have so far been vertical, meaning that Japan imports primary goods from those countries and exports manufactured goods to them.

She said the accounting firm, although it knew Technical Equities had severe cash flow and liquidity problems, was accused of not performing a proper audit of it. The complaint named four individuals, including two partners and two audit managers. Technical Equities, based in San Jose, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in February 1986, listing debts of 69.7 mln dlrs to 1,068 investors. Many of the investors were prominent sports and broadcasting figures. Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  \"ASEAN SHOWS MIXED PERFORMANCE IN 1986\\n\\nA sharp oil price decline and sharp fluctuations of exchange and interest rates in 1986 produced a mixed economic performance by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a United Nations study said. The annual report of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said the international economic environment reversed the fortunes of the trade-oriented economies of the six ASEAN member countries. It said the already low 1985 growth rates of ASEAN's oil exporting countries -- Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia -- dropped further after the oil price fall. Three oil importers -- Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand -- improved their performance mainly by restructuring their economies. But the report said the oil price fall reduced export earnings, worsening economic prospects for the exporters. The exporters' non-oil commodity prices did not show major improvement and protectionist pressures from industrial countries restricted export of manufactured products, it said. The GDPs of Indonesia, which was 1.9 pct in 1985, and Malaysia, which fell a real one pct, barely grew in 1986. The two countries, buffeted by unfavourable external factors in the past few years, were forced to curb aggregate domestic consumption demands last year to avoid severe balance of payments pressures and to resort to extensive commercial borrowings. The U.N. Body said the economic outlooks of Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines improved steadily in 1986 as the year advanced. It said the most favourable factor benefiting the three was the realignment of key currencies, especially the appreciation of the yen, which has resulted in the increased competitiveness of their exports against those from Japan. The report said the downward spiral plaguing the Philippine economy since 1983 was reversed into an estimated 0.9 pct GDP growth in 1986 with agriculture and public utilities becoming growth sectors. It said the resumption of the Philippines' sustained growth rests largely on a satisfactory solution of its debt problem. ESCAP said the yen appreciation, together with economic restructuring measures, played a big role in helping Singapore recover faster than expected from its 1.8 pct GDP decline in 1985. It said the Singapore GDP achieved a growth of over one pct last year after registering positive growth from the second quarter. The Singapore economic revival was hampered by its own adjustment measures especially its two-year wage freeze enforced last April, a glut of its property market and depressed conditions in its ASEAN neighbours which hurt Singapore because they take about a quarter of its total exports. The report said Thailand benefited from the changing world economic environment far more than any of its ASEAN neighbours. The Thai performance stemmed from the expansion o\\x7f its non-traditional export items last year to cover more manufactured products and its greater exploration of unsaturated export markets such as Asia, the Middle East and the European Community.

British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard told reporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange\\'s response to Britain\\'s non-negotiable timetable for increased British membership and warned of possible reprisals in the future. He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange (TSE) head Michio Takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchange access, as \"very frank indeed.\" In a separate press conference, TSE President Michio Takeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberalise its membership and called on Britain to make some concessions. According to Takeuchi, Howard wants three British firms to be named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of this year. Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies. \"Next May is the earliest possible date for opening our membership and I want the British government to understand this,\" Takeuchi said. Membership cannot be increased before space on the trading floor is expanded in May 1988, he said. Howard told reporters that was not good enough and said that Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financial institutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo. Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials from the two countries in May or June to come up with a postive response to the British timetable or face retaliation, he said. \"The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a very reasonable request and I expect it to be met,\" he said. Asked about the exchange\\'s argument that it has no floor space to expand membership, Howard replied, \"We find it very difficult in our country to understand why the considerable ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese (in world markets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind.\" While here, Howard said he also expressed frustration with the huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyo\\'s handling of demands by Britain\\'s Cable and Wireless for a greater role in Japan\\'s telecommunications business. According to Japanese newspaper reports, at least some of that message may have penetrated.

        "  'NO SPECIAL CHECKS AT GERMAN BANKS BECAUSE OF VW\\n\\nBanking supervisory authorities are not carrying out any special checks at banks in the wake of the currency fraud scandal at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, a spokesman for the Hesse regional state central bank, LZB, said. But inspectors are paying particular attention to foreign exchange matters in their routine checks at banks, he said in answer to enquiries. There is no evidence rules were broken. The LZB spokesman was commenting on press reports that banks had \"parked\" open currency positions for short periods with VW to circumvent regulations limiting the size of open currency positions that can be carried by banks overnight. The press allegations emerged after VW said it may have lost 480 mln marks as a result of a possible currency fraud. LZBs are regional branches of the Bundesbank. Their inspectors also act for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin, which regulates banking in West Germany. Following the 1974 Herstatt bank crash on currency speculation, West Germany limited a bank\\'s total open positions overnight to 30 pct of shareholders\\' equity and reserves. German press reports have said some banks circumvented this rule by selling excess positions to VW, then repurchasing them. The banking regulations only cover banks. Company foreign exchange activities are not subject to the banking regulators. The LZB spokesman said there were no concrete signs that the regulations had been broken, and it would be irresponsible to instigate a special check just on the basis of the reports. The LZBs receive monthly balance sheet statistics from banks in their areas, which they check, and they also routinely inspect all banks in greater detail over longer periods. But LZB officials said it would be hard for inspectors to detect a breach of these rules as they do not check companies and therefore would not see both sides of any parking deal. \"If the managements of the banks have not spotted them, it will be even harder for our inspectors,\" said one official. It would be up to the public prosecutors to order special checks on suspicion of breaches of these regulations, they said. Prosecutors in Brunswick are already investigating the VW currency scandal, and have ordered the arrest of VW\\'s former chief foreign exchange dealer. Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished by a 100,000 mark fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme cases by removal of the managers if their active involvement is proved.

Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve\\'s 50 pct margin requirements. The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it,\" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year.

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 22. U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue, but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of \"the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.\" Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs. Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments. The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.

Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels. But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners. \"There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,\" he said. \"We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a \"slight firming\" of the yen against the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar. \"The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,\" he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation. \"And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress,\" he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis. \"You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,\" he said. REUTER \\x03',\n",

The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.

Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas.

        "  'TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA <BAC> EQUITY OFFER\\n\\nBankAmerica Corp is not under pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock\\'s recent poor performance, banking analysts said. Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt. The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news. Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp <I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9. A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated. \"The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,\" said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica\\'s Vice President for Financial Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval. \"I\\'d put it off as long as they conceivably could,\" said Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith. Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook. Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group. Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co. He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico\\'s debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news. Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp <I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9. A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated. \"The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,\" said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica\\'s Vice President for Financial Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval. \"I\\'d put it off as long as they conceivably could,\" said Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith. Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook. Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group. Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co. He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico\\'s debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor reported earnings of 40 cts a share. Douglas also said the year\\'s sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year. He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings \"will probably be off slightly\" from last year\\'s 40 cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share. Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be \"enough for us to exceed the prior year\\'s overall earnings\" of 1.53 dlrs a share. In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience \"a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone.\" President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co. Dean also said the company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West Chicago. He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I.

        "  'BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT\\n\\nVenezuela and its bank advisory committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February, bankers said. They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms. The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today, the bankers said. \"A number of details have still to be finalized, but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place,\" one senior banker said. The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year. It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela. The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been going on intermittently for several months, follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel. And last night Citibank said Mexico\\'s financing package, including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20. While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental, bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of Brazil\\'s unilateral interest suspension last Friday.

        "  'TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN\\'S HOPES OF REBOUND\\n\\nThe Tower Commission report, which says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington, political analysts said. \"This is certification of incompetence,\" private political analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower report made public today. \"It\\'s as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials.\" In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican senator from Texas, told a press conference, \"The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation.\" The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the Republican president\\'s own choosing. The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party. \"We\\'re falling by our own hand,\" said one Republican political strategist. \"What can we say except \\'we\\'re sorry, we won\\'t do it again\\'?\" The strategist, who works for one of his party\\'s top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said the report was like \"an anvil falling on us.\" Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan\\'s hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress, the press and the Washington bureaucracy. The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president. \"They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences,\" it said. White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases. Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid \"chaos\" in the disclosure process. Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health reasons last month. \"This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes,\" Tower told reporters. While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country\\'s policy agenda -- particularly with Congress controlled by the Democrats. The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair. Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November, his personal popularity is still relatively high. A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president. American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a Democrat, says Reagan\\'s loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public. \"In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public,\" Schneider said. Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week. But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround. \"The White House has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met,\" said the strategist, who requested anonymity. \"They have to recognize there is no quick fix.\" Analysts also point out that Reagan\\'s personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies. They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November\\'s elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the Senate to the Democrats. Reuter \\x03',\n",

With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector, falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy. But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment. \"It\\'s a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. \"I\\'m particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought.\" The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders. Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws. \"It\\'s more expensive to invest than it used to be, so people just aren\\'t doing it as much,\" Wyss said. Increases in durable goods orders at year\\'s end reinforced the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws, economists said.

But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused by more than tax reform. \"The wash-out that took place in January was far greater than the actual gains that took place in November and December,\" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"The economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year.\" \"The report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters,\" said Donald Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said. \"It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which may quickly translate to a drop in production,\" Midland Montagu\\'s Maude said. Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of January\\'s report, given that other reports have reflected strength. But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in December. He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December. \"Given these numbers, there\\'s no reason for the Fed to tighten,\" Data Resources\\' Wyss said. \"But there\\'s no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. The Fed will wait and see,\" he added. Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. \"People aren\\'t talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will have to ease to ensure global growth.\" Reuter \\x03',\n",

Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. \"Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items where such actions will not endanger our national security, and eliminate the Department of Defense\\'s de facto veto authority over the licensing process,\" Cranston said. \"Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65 to 70 pct,\" he told reporters. \"I am convinced that a more rational...licensing process will boost exports.\" U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc countries access to technology that could further their military capabilities. \"By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to our adversaries while promoting more exports,\" Cranston said. \"We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place,\" Evans told reporters.

        "  'KEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS\\n\\nThe chairmen and senior Republican members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to an employee stock ownership plan. The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991. If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions after Sept 26, 1987. The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen Bob Packwood (R-Ore). In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less than 300 mln dlrs for the same years. He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement, \"The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax entirely when they die.\" He added, \"The provision was intended to encourage estates to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as is currently estimated.\" He added, \"The bill I have introduced today calls for the modification of the provision in accordance with its intended purpose.\" Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  'QUEBECOR <PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY\\n\\nQuebecor Inc, one of Canada\\'s largest publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview. The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec government\\'s 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company <Donohue Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said. \"I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This is not definite but i think we will,\" he said, adding that he plans to announce a decision early next week. Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the second-largest circulation paper in Canada. A new daily would give Montreal its second English- language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North America, analysts have said. Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new venture would have the support of major advertisers. Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55 pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project but has not decided whether he would take partners in the newspaper venture. He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures. \"It would be the possibility of doing something else in the short term,\" Peladeau said. Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert Maxwell\\'s British Printing and Communications Corp plc <BPCL.L> does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects. Peladeau and Maxwell\\'s companies teamed up to buy the stake in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the govvernment\\'s stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British printing acquiring the other 49 pct. \"In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. There were days when we didn\\'t have enough paper to print the paper,\" Peladeau said. \"When I lived that, I said to myself...next time we\\'ll be ready.\" Peladeau said most of Donohue\\'s current total newsprint capacity however, is already committed to other buyers. Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year and Maxwell\\'s company, which publishes Britain\\'s Daily Mirror newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes. Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49 pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue\\'s 540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build another mill to meet their demands . He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the government. Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with Maxwell\\'s company, either in the newspaper market in France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire. He said Maxwell\\'s sons, who are French citizens, would provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in France or the U.S. Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada, Peladeau said. He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province. Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock Exchange listing. Reuter \\x03',\n",

The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received in London, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into Iraq on January 9 was now over. It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had \"dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the history of the Iraq-imposed war.\" The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in southern Iraq. \"The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance power of its army...,\" said the statement quoted by IRNA. It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of Baghdad to \"come to their senses\" and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in Iraq. Iran said its forces had \"liberated\" 155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into Basra. The Iranian forces \"are in full control of these areas,\" the statement said. It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally destroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. The victory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti- aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers.

The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed\\'s reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been \"acting a bit strangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday\\'s high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday\\'s float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks. Reuter \\x03',\n",
        "  'AMERICAN EXPRESS <AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF\\n\\nAmerican Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts\\' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. At the meeting, company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson, according to analysts. Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year. \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very profitable securities firm.\" Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past. \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson\\'s book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization,\" said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally. \"They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road,\" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis. \"They\\'ve outlined the fact that they\\'re investing heavily in the future, which goes heavily into the international arena,\" said Lewis. \"...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way,\" he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business. \"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company,\" he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter \\x03',\n",

Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program\\'s impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it. Reuter \\x03',\n",

He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela\\'s 13-bank advisory committee except to say, \"they are progressing.\" Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil\\'s decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate according to its own interest. Asked to comment on chile\\'s agreement with its creditors today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor, azpurua said only, \"that is good news.\" According to banking sources, the banks\\' latest offer to venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last february\\'s 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct Venezuela wants. Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule, and debt capitalization schemes. Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. It was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector. He said venezuela\\'s original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans. The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans. \"debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed,\" azpurua said. However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments, \"because circumstances change too quickly.\" At the same time, he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries. The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank. Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  'OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS\\n\\nOPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. \"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems,\" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. \"OPEC\\'s problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way,\" said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market\\'s earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. \"OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,\" said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. \"The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again,\" he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. \"They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens,\" Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.\" Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC\\'s ability to hold together prices and output. \"OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then,\" said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University\\'s Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. \"Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production,\" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank\\'s foreign debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.

        "  'LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987\\n\\nLiquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year. \"Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989,\" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern <PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp <CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern <BNI>, has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible. \"On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment,\" Frank Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices, Shearson\\'s Tulis said. In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand. Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values.

        "  'U.S. FARM CREDIT RESCUE BILL SEEN BEFORE EASTER\\n\\nThe chairman of the Senate Agriculture subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its regulator do not ask for help by then. \"We\\'re going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you, before the Easter recess,\" Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said. Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said. Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the system\\'s regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid. Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA, as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all its capital and needs federal government help. However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the system\\'s remaining capital is tied-up in legal action, he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed. But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify aid is needed, it should request help informally. \"We all know we need a capital infusion,\" Boren said. Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years. While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts. \"A significant number of banks and associations in the most economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer extraordinary losses,\" Beesley said. Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay loans. The system\\'s total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year. FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders. \"The bondholders have no worry at this time,\" Billington said. Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation of the system into a centralized national lender, to de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions. But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors. Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent could be developed without Congressional legislation. Reuter \\x03',\n",
        "  'REPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN\\n\\nThe Tower Commission\\'s scathing comments on President Reagan\\'s embattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure, but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear. Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of Reagan\\'s worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November. But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been muted until the release of the Tower Commission report. \"Their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the president,\" the report said after a three-month probe. \"Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program. They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages.\" The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more importantly, Reagan\\'s wife Nancy. \"More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser,\" said the report. Washington analysts said Regan\\'s departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower Commission\\'s findings next week. With Regan\\'s departure apparently imminent and Poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the report\\'s tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally, told reporters the report disclosed \"colossal blunders\" and said people who had not served the president well should step aside, but he did not specify who should go. \"It would seem to me that if you don\\'t protect the president, you don\\'t serve the president well, then you should move on,\" the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate next year, said. One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not be the only White House official to leave in the near future. Reuter \\x03',\n",
        "  'SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS\\n\\nSwitzerland\\'s economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said. The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year\\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years. But \"given Switzerland\\'s large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,\" the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said. As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said. Particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position,\" it said. REUTER \\x03',\n",
        "  'U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT\\n\\nThe U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said. However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future. \"The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,\" an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. \"But there just isn\\'t much talk about it, informally or formally.\" Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months. \"I just don\\'t see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process,\" the aide to Lyng said. \"An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,\" said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng\\'s aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration\\'s interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative\\'s Office said. In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration\\'s previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of \"calm, basic, factual economics.\" Another USDA official said there was \"not even an informal suggestion or hint\" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

The Treasury announcecement did not name the other countries nor the amount of financing the United States was willing to supply. Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and other financing. \"Our willingness to participate in this multilateral short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina\\'s economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable balance of payments position,\" the Treassury statement said. In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine officials said the country needed \"a more serene climate\" to carry out structural changes in the economy. But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week. The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The one-page statement noted the International Monetary Fund expressed confidence in Argentina\\'s economic policies and prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for it on February 18. \"Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation of its economic program,\" the statement said.

The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for several days.

It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about 1,150 plaintiffs. In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the plaintiffs.

Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island, N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.

        "  'FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT\\n\\nThe sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today. \"Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds),\" one CBT crush trader said. \"But they\\'ve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,\" he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days. The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added. With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins. A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said. Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added. Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  'FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY\\n\\nLatest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. \"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed,\" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed\\'s policy \"has been unchanged up to today.\" Although Volcker\\'s statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today\\'s data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed\\'s decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today\\'s data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. \"The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday,\" said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. \"But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous.\" \"The Fed couldn\\'t have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections,\" added Security Pacific\\'s Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed\\'s discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists\\' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. \"There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings,\" said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. \"For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. \"I expect it to continue in that vein.\" \"Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs,\" added First Chicago\\'s Johnson. Banks\\' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar\\'s progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. \"The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar\\'s effect on Fed policy,\" said First Chicago\\'s Johnson. \"Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won\\'t pull back from easing.\" Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  'FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES\\n\\nFrance\\'s right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year. Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988. \"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\" said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. \"We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year.\" \"The big question is whether the government\\'s policy of wage moderation will be maintained,\" he added. The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity. But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices. Calling the government\\'s policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France\\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority. But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands. \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas. Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said. Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent. \"But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed,\" he commented. Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs. But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control. Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE, Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added. Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said. So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.

        "  'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN EYEING FOREIGN STOCKS\\n\\nJapanese life insurers, trust banks and corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the U.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said. After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years, Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments, they said. Japan\\'s net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said. Matsumoto, who manages Nikko\\'s investment research and strategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year, but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months. Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added. This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said. \"The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years,\" said Eugene Atkinson, managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp. Wall Street\\'s massive turnover offers good liquidity, enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added. However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling. They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said. Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S. Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse, manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd\\'s international fixed income activities. There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added. Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S. Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S. Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months. Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations, he added. Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies. Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West Germany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said. Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks, he added. One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies. The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European bonds, he said. Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan. \"Last week was the busiest week we had,\" he said. Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms, fund managers said. Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc, they said. Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony\\'s long-term political stability, they added. Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany, particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts, are concerned about the recent dollar fall. Australia also poses some risks due to currency values, they added. REUTER \\x03',\n",

They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said. On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate, the ministry sources said.

However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated. \"The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,\" he said. Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said. \"They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time,\" he said. \"On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment.\" Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. \"Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane,\" he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year. \"The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88,\" Keating said. \"As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,\" he said.

        "  'PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS\\n\\nTalks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil\"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world\"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers \"want to have the ball only in their court and it isn\"t fair,\" minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. \"Anything is possible at this phase,\" even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.

Production of Indonesia\"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia\"s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks. \"Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,\" the report says. \"The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels.\" Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as \"wereng\" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September\"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia\"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump. REUTER \\x03',\n",
        "  'KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS\\n\\nKuwait\"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting.\" He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\" Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body\"s members. Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec\"s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April.\" But he expected the situation would later improve. REUTER \\x03',\n",
        "  'INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE\\n\\nIndonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\" the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia\"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country\"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, \"there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.\" \"This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,\" the report says. Indonesia\"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia\"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. \"This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s,\" the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. \"For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry.\" \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture,\" the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. REUTER \\x03',\n",

They said the budget failed to provide incentives for economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform. But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a vote winner. The Indian Express, the country\"s biggest selling paper, said: \"The defence cow has never been holier.\" The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget \"shamelessly political.\" It said in a front page commentary the \"budget is bad for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and neutral in respect of everything else.\" Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done little for them. Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries. Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago. Reaction in Bombay, India\"s business capital, was generally unfavourable. Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan. Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income. Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India\"s biggest, fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi\"s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry. The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times. Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales. Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital gains tax. Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come. REUTER \\x03',\n",

He did not give details but said, \"It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing.\" Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country\\'s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price.

The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year\\'s allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country\\'s foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day.

        "  'GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS\\n\\nGulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank\\'s economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had \"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.\" In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities\\' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said.

Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia \"is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance.\" Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices \"may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market.\" Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia\\'s adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement. \"We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions,\" he said.

It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct. A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. But production remained vigorous, with more than three times as many members reporting it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually resumed production. The same number of members reported inventories were higher as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.

        "  'EC MINISTERS CONSIDER BIG AGRICULTURE PRICE CUTS\\n\\nEuropean Community (EC) agriculture ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by European farmers, Community officials said. The common target for the farmers\\' wrath is the EC\\'s Brussels Commission, which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such action. With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as EC members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. A producer\\'s right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus. The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the \"green\" exchange rate system, which translates EC farm prices into national currencies. The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides the EC with the bulk of its soybeans. It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line. REUTER \\x03',\n",

The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a statement. The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747 family, he said. The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet to 28, he said. Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will announce a decision on engine purchases later this year. He said they are United Technologies Corp <UTX> unit <Pratt^M and Whitney>, General Electric Co <GE> and Britain's <Rolls-Royce^M Ltd>. He said the 747-400, which incorporates new technology such as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced electronics, should have its first flight next February. The 400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms further than the current Qantas 747-300's, he said. The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said. The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel saving, he said. The higher range and payload means they will first be used on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia. They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney and Los Angeles. REUTER \\x03\",\n",

There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas. The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually isolated. A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which has about 16,000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges in the area had been damaged. No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud slip. Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes, the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were followed by a series of aftershocks. The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions in the northeast of the North Island. Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more than a week. Police said many districts lost power supplies and telephone links. Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam, 32 kilometres above Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river.

The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on another 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to any new agreement, the officials said. Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR portend well for the Philippines, despite Brazil's repayment suspension last week, the officials said. Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since 1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16 percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a 77 billion dlr rescue. Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which is currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct. The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7. Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional 5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments. One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type accord, which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing to endorse five months after it was signed. In Manila's case, about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs outstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks on the advisory committee, while about 180 smaller banks have average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each.

They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc <TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.

The embassy\\'s annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags produced in 1985/86. In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags. The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the \"probable\" re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation. Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988. Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000 tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987. The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985. The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans. The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia\\'s CTC (crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants. Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.

The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York authorities. Gordon Macklin, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers in Washington, said he was very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end of this month. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local financial support for the plan existed. Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore filling a gap when no trading takes place. A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start of three-centre trading to determine investor interest. The Singapore, London and New York authorities have agreed in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and transfer information among the different time zones, but some details still have to be worked out, a senior Singapore bank director said. Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market liquidity and communication links to the other three centres. But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a head start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong, Toyko and Australia, he said. On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ), modelled on NASDAQ. At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one company, the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd (SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small firms have said they plan to seek listings soon. Market sources expect the next few companies listed will also be government-owned entities, which would have no problem meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon, they said. SNP, previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd, issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times.

Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume for the Bundesbank\\'s two-week bond calendar beginning today. \"We want to have a week\\'s pause,\" one manager said. Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks, including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank. Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks, from 3.6 billion in January. The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons. \"I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you can give a good coupon,\" another manager said. But even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions. Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone, bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows. Den Danske\\'s 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland\\'s 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price. A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price. Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the 10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said. The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain about the Bundesbank\\'s present fixed calendar system, which they say is too inflexible. Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again. Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system. The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be completely abolished. \"I don\\'t think the Bundesbank would give that up,\" one banking analyst said. \"I wouldn\\'t have anything against getting rid of the system,\" the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves. The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket, he said. For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system. Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to the carnival holiday. Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday. In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon. REUTER \\x03',\n",

Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one of resignation, with many bankers seeing little alternative for Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign debt of about 50 billion dlrs, although about half is thought to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit, a 500 mln dlr deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank, was signed in October, 1985 and is still in a two year grace period. The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing. But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and western government export credit agencies has been underway. Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of obligations due on letters of credit. REUTER \\x03\",\n",

Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues, they said. \"Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets,\" a Nikko Securities house bond manager said. Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now, the securities managers said. Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end, and accept issue requests during the month, they said. Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market, securities managers said. Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>. The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms, securities sources said. The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds. Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic, they said. The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market, securities house managers said. The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said. The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said. The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system, more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process, securities sources said. It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and for deregulation of private placements, they said. Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in 1988, the sources said. REUTER \\x03',\n",

The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment. Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium.

Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said. In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier <NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo <VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco <ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>. Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB <SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB <ALFS ST>. During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB <ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.

It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target. Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86.

A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria\\'s 19 billion dlr foreign debt, bankers said. The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans. \"The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation\\'s debt situation,\" said another Japanese bank official. He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details. Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria, representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions, banking sources said. They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987.

They said Nakasone\\'s reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988. \"Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration, which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican,\" Rei Shiratori, professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters. \"Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,\" Shiratori said. Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax. \"There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies,\" he told a meeting of government and party leaders. \"If the party discipline is broken, I would like to see punishment considered.\" \"A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it,\" Shiratori said. \"Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen\\'s appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging,\" he said. Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April, involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP, the political analysts added. Shiratori said, \"In the worst case, implementation of the sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision. \"Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct. \"A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs,\" he said. Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University, thought the last possibility most likely. \"I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills,\" he said. The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House. To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign, Sato said. \"Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed,\" he said.

        "  \"ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS\\n\\nMine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period. REUTER \\x03\",\n",

        "  'SAN MIGUEL BOARD APPOINTMENT MAY MEAN CHANGES\\n\\nDisagreement over management of <San Miguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government\\'s appointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board, investment analysts said. They told Reuters the presence of <United Coconut Planters Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean changes in SMC management, which for decades was controlled by the family of its president, Andres Soriano. Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls 51 pct of San Miguel\\'s stock, after another nominee resigned. The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds six seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mln sequestered shares. The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by Eduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and he left the country after Marcos\\'s fall. Before the seizure, Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for the shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit. The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They traded at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at Friday\\'s close. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the objections of some directors associated with Soriano. \"I don\\'t think there is a conflict of interest as such,\" he said. \"I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a contentious manner,\" Ongpin added. The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing Sy\\'s directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that a pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC\\'s 500 mln peso deposit and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a clear conflict. UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy\\'s appointment, petitioning the PCGG \"so that the interests of the owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected.\" Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers who claim ownership of the disputed shares. The analysts said Sy, backed by the government, would probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government officials from working for private companies. SMC\\'s annual election is scheduled for May. A UCPB spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to the PCGG to decide whom to appoint. One analyst said objections were understandable from the family that founded the company 97 years ago. \"It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano,\" he said. SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales of 10.36 billion. REUTER \\x03',\n",

        "  'INDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION\\n\\nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\\'s fiscal 1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit will push up India\\'s moderate inflation rate and that the country\\'s stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty, economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters. The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is 56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. Economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he said. But few analysts have taken Gandhi\\'s assurance seriously. They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party, said Gandhi\\'s failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects, after bad weather last year, may strain prices further. Economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes, which will discourage savings, economists said. Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. Brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three. Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, \"There is uncertainty in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure.\" But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene. \"Just now there is acute nervousness in the market,\" he said. Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market on a long-term basis. New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

        "  'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY\\n\\nHungary is to embark on a new series of austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985. The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints. But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry\\'s budget financing division, told Reuters the government now saw this as too high and had decided \"quite severe\" measures were needed. \"All the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures,\" he said. Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: \"The Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results, and of course the Fund would support these efforts.\" IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year. Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary\\'s state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms, which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency. The exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said. Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985. Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints. \"I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies,\" Boesze said. \"The central administration must be hard. ... If we are not hard then we will not be successful.\" Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. \"I believe these reserves should not be used at all,\" he said. Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct. The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct. This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1. About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices. Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made this difficult. But he added: \"I think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well.\" He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. The IMF supports these aims. Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms. Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily. Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. He gave no exact figures. Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct. After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion). Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986, Boesze said. Hungary\\'s net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years earlier. Boesze said last year\\'s budget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds. Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country\\'s economy was in a \"very difficult\" situation, but not in crisis. There would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year, however, and borrowing must be used more effectively. \"Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,\" Berecz said.

        "  'DIGITAL AUDIO TAPE PLAYERS GO ON SALE IN JAPAN\\n\\nJapanese consumers hesitated about buying the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player\\'s near-perfect sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper. \"The sound is great, but I\\'ll wait until more machines hit the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying one,\" said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee. Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers said. Aiwa\\'s machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen. Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear as early as the end of March, industry sources said. DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality. This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the DAT player\\'s debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines. Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier. \"Nobody can tell the difference,\" one salesman said. DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a profitable niche. Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market, industry analysts said. They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per year. Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT player on the world market later this year. REUTER \\x03',\n",
        "  'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ITALIAN BOOM\\n\\nItaly\\'s strong economic revival has led some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects, but many Italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive. \"I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism,\" says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy\\'s leading economists and a professor at Rome University. According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minute seen as the \"bad boy of Europe\" and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration, \"I think there\\'s a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark room.\" Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists here, stress Italy\\'s recent achievements, particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable. Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A., <FIAT.M> and <ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world\\'s fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism. Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries. Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain. Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system. But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say. \"We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,\" warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti. He says that while Italy\\'s recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved. The country\\'s huge state sector deficit, high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems, experts say. The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at 109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral again, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luiss university in Rome. Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness, economists and industrialists say. And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last October according to the latest official data. Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million people seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at 17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product (GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment. Another problem is Italy\\'s reliance on imported raw materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs. This factor actually worked sharply in Italy\\'s favour last year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country\\'s trade deficit to 3,717 billion lire by year end from 23,085 billion lire in 1985. But economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences. If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world\\'s top industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities, economists say. Italy has no controls on insider trading. The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures, economists say. \"Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, I doubt I\\'d find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that,\" says Spaventa.

        "  'JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS\\n\\nJapan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz\\'s one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. \"We appreciate their frustration,\" a senior Japanese government official said. \"But we are also frustrated.\" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. \"It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,\" a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan\\'s favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow\\'s topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. \"It condemns Japan without due process,\" one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration\\'s trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. \"We have no leverage,\" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.

The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry. According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace. The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.

Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday. He did not give details but said, \"It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing.\" Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country\\'s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price. It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures. It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement. The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines\\' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments. \"(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative,\" Ongpin said. \"Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World) Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received.\" \"We don\\'t believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side,\" Ongpin said. \"We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms.

Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had decided not to insist on Manila\\'s creditor banks pledging to fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion dlrs. \"He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as possible. I\\'m saying that\\'s very short-sighted,\" Monsod said. Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6 billion dlrs of the Philippines\\' total foreign debt of 27.8 billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource transfer in the same period. Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Monsod said, \"Right now we are saying to the banks, let\\'s share the financing burden.\" Ongpin said last month the country\\'s consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth facility to bridge the funding gap. He said the government and the consultative group would meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to finance any gap on a shared basis. He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to pin the banks down on Monsod\\'s proposed growth facility. Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics. \"Secretary Monsod and I get along famously,\" he said. \"She talks and I listen but I don\\'t necessarily agree.\" Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government\\'s pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan. She said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years. \"If you don\\'t get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. How can there be a program if there is no finance?\" she said, adding Ongpin\\'s stand was not good for the economy. \"It (Ongpin\\'s stand) is going to make it much more difficult for the economy to attain its growth targets,\" Monsod said. \"Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not be able to come back (from New York) in a day,\" she said. Monsod, the government\\'s chief economic planner, stressed Manila\\'s policy was growth before debt. She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, the Philippines should copy Brazil\\'s action last week in freezing all debt repayments. \"If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of the money that you are sending abroad, then of course you have an option,\" Monsod said. \"You just don\\'t send it abroad.

Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel <X> gradually resumed production. An equal number of members reported inventories were higher and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one. Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM\\'s business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc <PBI> said \"the economy continued to expand in February, but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter.\" The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

        "  'FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL NEEDS MORE, FASTER FINANCE\\n\\nBrazil would not have suspended payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more and faster financing from official lending agencies, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. He said he would not seek more money from the International Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and said Brazil\\'s problems could not be solved by IMF intervention. \"It\\'s a question of why the official lending agencies don\\'t finance a little bit more quickly and easily,\" Funaro told reporters at the Brazilian Embassy. Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied, \"Yes, because our country did not receive financing from these agencies.\" Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funaro said \"It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to receive from the other side.\" Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs, stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks. Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans. He said the net transfer was hurting the country\\'s continued growth and capacity to import goods. \"Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to be found to finance a country like Brazil,\" Funaro said. He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he would like to see \"automatic\" official lending when needed so that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves, now reported to be below four billion dlrs. Funaro said Brazil had the world\\'s third-largest trade surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight billion dlrs. But he said that without increased and faster lending from official institutions, the nation could not rely on its export earnings to finance development and imports and also service its debt. \"We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and internal adjustment,\" Funaro said. He complained that official lending agencies had imposed tight control on credit over the past four years, leaving commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available. Funaro said U.S officials understand his position \"but they don\\'t like it.\" Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe and debt discussions with officials in Britain, West Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. Brazil\\'s central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over Brazil\\'s request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines.

        "  'AMERICAN EXPRESS <AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS\\n\\nAmerican Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon\\'s access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express\\' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express\\' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express\\' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. \"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to,\" said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson\\'s operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week\\'s market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson\\'s takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage. Reuter \\x03',\n",

The surplus, including cash transactions and long-term investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986 budget. All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast. The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18 billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61 billion proposed in the original 1986 budget. Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985 figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71 billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling 1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985 deficit of 696 mln. Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions. Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said. The ministry said the improvement in the overall account reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax increases. But economic factors, including the low rate of inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil prices were also important factors. A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs of government debt, which accounted for the difference between the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln franc overall surplus.

        "  'APPLE COMPUTER <AAPL> UPGRADES MACINTOSH LINE\\n\\nApple Computer Inc today will announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable Macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the business market. The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than earlier models. The Mac SE (SE stands for \"system expansion\"), which Apple says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus, goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features. The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs. Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for about 2,200 dlrs. Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld Conference in Los Angeles. Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the expanding market for science and engineering workstations. John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer, declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SE should contribute significantly to Apple\\'s bottom line this year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users. \"I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for most people,\" he said. \"My sense is that it will be a real power product for revenue.\" Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers but expected the new products to do well. \"Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation,\" he told Reuters. \"The graphics interface on the Mac products is significantly better than anything IBM has to date.\" International Business Machines is expected to announce updated personal computers this spring. The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an \"open architecture\" that allows for the addition of numerous peripheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of memory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor. In a demonstration of its speed and power, company executives said they thought the Mac II would push the development of software for Apple computers in new directions that could include sophisticated video editing, electronic mail systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use. The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256 colors or shades of gray. The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and will be shipped with one megabyte RAM, expandable to four megabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen.

The trust said independent petroleum engineers\\' preliminary annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted present value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural gas prices.

Usingprices received in January 1987, however, it said the estimate would have been about 87 mln dlrs. LL and E noted that there has been some weakening in prices since January. The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama and Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986, as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production costs after expenses of nitrogen injection.

Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator\\'s U.S. courier business. Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company. Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc, will be majority owner of the company. Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator\\'s stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator\\'s U.S. courier operations. If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations. Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Purolator\\'s stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs. This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business. Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant. Purolator\\'s courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet. E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called \"bridge\" financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said. \"Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future,\" said Idsal. William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.

BankAmerica Corp\\'s <BAC> Bank of America unit last week issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors. The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp\\'s <RPT> RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager. However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more closely related to the so-called \"cars deals\" that raced to market last year than were the RepublicBank securities. \"The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle,\" he said. In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust, analysts explained. The Bank of America certificates were issued by California Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single purpose, investment bankers pointed out. The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal was rated AAA by both Moody\\'s and Standard and Poor\\'s. Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. \"AAA-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries when First Boston priced the deal,\" one said. However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway. The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal\\'s top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year\\'s cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone. \"Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months,\" Dub detailed. Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year. The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said. Last week\\'s deal was Bank of America\\'s second foray into the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted. In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc. Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and 450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc <MACK>, via Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.

        "  'REAGAN AND BAKER BEGIN TASK OF REBUILDING\\n\\nAfter a week that left his presidency shaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and his new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal. Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker, whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon. Among the chores facing Reagan\\'s new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency. White House officials are checking to see how much support Gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said. Appearing on the NBC News program, \"Meet the Press,\" the Kansas senator said the Gates nomination \"could be in some difficulty.\" Aides said that Gates\\' future would be given high priority by Baker. Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair. \"He has the smell of Iran on him,\" said former Nevada Sen. and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. \"He is a victim.\" Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, \"This Week With David Brinkley,\" bluntly admitted \"the Gates nomination is in trouble.\" Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates. When asked on the syndicated television program, \"John McLaughlin: One on One,\" if he thought Gates would be confirmed, the Georgia Democrat shot back: \"I wouldn\\'t bet any money on it. \"I think this report hurts that,\" Nunn said. \"It indicates that the National Security Council had policy-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we\\'re going to go into that with Mr. Gates. Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower report prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief of staff. Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasury secretary who has been the president\\'s top aide for the past two years, was assigned the lion\\'s share of the blame for the botched handling of the Iran arms sale. The report blamed Regan for the \"chaos that descended on the White House\" since it was first revealed last November that profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. The two other victims of the scandal are former National Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Tower commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, have refused to testify. Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy. That perception has wrecked Reagan\\'s popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan\\'s leadership, a record low, and a third believed he should consider resignation. After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen. John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television address this week to respond to the criticisms of his presidency. Reuter \\x03',\n",

        "  'BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE\\n\\nBrazil is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil\\'s debt to banks, he said, adding \"This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks.\" The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations\\' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis, \"Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors,\" central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan. The crisis began when Brazil\\'s trade surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country\\'s\\x7fate of inflation. Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil\\'s 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt. \"What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service, because we cannot service all that,\" he said. \"I really think we have to change the old rules.\" Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis, Funaro said \"We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the banks have some limits.\" \"It is a political discussion from our point of view,\" he said. Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk to the commercial banks \"If I\\'ve got some solution from the governments. I can\\'t take the burden only to the banks.\" He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. \\x7f In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982. \"You must open these mechanisms,\" he said. He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by Brazil\\'s suspension of interest payments, they understood Brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves. Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed \"because we can\\'t stay as we were the last few years.\" \"I\\'m trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium.\" he said. Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable. Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. Banking sources noted that Brazil\\'s monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world, Funaro said, although its share of international trade was only one pct. \"The solution is linked with growth, not recession,\" he said, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. Banking sources said Brazil\\'s debts to foreign governments, as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder structure following last month\\'s rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.
