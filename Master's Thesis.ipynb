      "Abstract: We investigate the relationship between thermodynamic and information theoretic inefficiency in an individual neuron model, the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron. Recent work has revealed that minimization of energy dissipation is tightly related to optimal information processing, in the sense that a system has to compute a maximally predictive model. In this thesis we justify the extension of these results to the neuron and quantify the neuron\u2019s thermodynamic and information processing inefficiency as a function of spike frequency adaptation."
