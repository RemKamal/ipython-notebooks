      "# Kaggle Competition - Predicting relative stock price\n",

      "For this competition, you are asked to predict the percentage change in a financial instrument at a time 2 hours in the future.  The data represents features of various financial securities (198 in total) recorded at 5-minute intervals throughout a trading day.  To discourage cheating, you are not provided with the features' names or the specific dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "__data.zip__ - contains features for 510 days worth of trading, including 200 training days and 310 testing days  \n",
      "__trainLabels.csv__ - contains the targets for the 200 training days  \n",
      "__sampleSubmission.csv__ - shows the submission format\n",
      "\n",
      "Each variable named O1, O2, O3, etc. (the outputs) represents a percent change in the value of a security.  Each variable named I1, I2, I3, etc. (the inputs) represents a feature. The underlying securities and features represented by these anonymized names are the same across all files (e.g. O1 will always be the same stock).\n",
      "\n",
      "Within each trading day, you are provided the outputs as a relative percentage compared to the previous day's closing price.  The first line of each data file represents the previous close. For example, if a security closed at \\$1 the previous day and opened at \\$2 the next day, the first output would be 0, then 100.  All output values are computed relative to the previous day's close. The timestamps within each file are as follows (ignoring the header row):\n",

      "Line 1 = Outputs and inputs at previous day's close (4PM ET)  \n",
      "Line 2 = Outputs and inputs at current day's open (9:30AM ET)  \n",

      "###Results\n",
      "- Last-observed benchmark is surprisingly good; achieves private score of 0.44 and public score of 0.42007\n",
      "- An increase in the private performance doesn't necessarily correspond to a better public score, for instance  \n",
      "    - Exponential filter with 0.5 discount rate gets a better private score than 0.9 discount rate, but a worse public score\n",
      "- Using a linear model (per stock) of last observed price and the direction (derivative) doesn't improve public score\n",
      "    - This could just be because I'm improperly optimizing the coefficients\n",
      "- My best result so far is $x_{i,t} = a_i x_{i,t-1} + b_i$ where $x_{i,t-1}$ is the last observed price and where $i$ is the $i^{\\rm th}$ stock\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "###To-do\n",
      "- I'm using handwritten gradient descent, but could probably use scipy optimize for better results\n",
      "- Actually use features\n",
      "- Try random forests\n"
